## Machine Coding Round Problems (90‚Äì120 mins)

Here‚Äôs a list of machine coding round problems that fit a **90‚Äì120 min** window, are popular in interviews, and are meaty enough to show design + coding skills.

---

### **1. Real-world Simulation Systems**
These are similar to the Parking Lot problem ‚Äî you have entities, rules, and operations.

- **Parking Lot System** *(you already have)*
- **Vending Machine**  
  - Supports multiple items, coins, change return, out-of-stock handling  
  - Demonstrate State Pattern  
- **ATM Simulation**  
  - Withdrawals, deposits, balance check, multiple accounts  
  - Focus on SOLID & transaction handling  
- **Elevator System**  
  - Multiple elevators, request scheduling strategy  
  - Demonstrates concurrency handling  
- **Coffee Machine** (like Starbucks self-service)  
  - Multiple drink types, ingredients, low-stock alerts  
  - Demonstrate Observer Pattern  

---

### **2. Games**
Easier to visualize, fun to implement, good for showing OOP design.

- **Tic Tac Toe** *(you‚Äôve done)*
- **Snake and Ladder**  
  - Add players, dice rolls, snakes, ladders, win condition  
  - Extendable to multiple boards  
- **Chess Move Validator** (limited scope)  
  - Not full game, just validate moves for given pieces  
- **Battleship Game**  
  - 2-player game, grid, ships placement, hit/miss tracking

### **3. Data Processing Utilities**
Good for Java Streams / collections / algorithms focus.

- **Log File Analyzer**  
  - Parse logs, group by error type, count occurrences, search by keyword  
- **Library Management System (Lite)**  
  - Search books, issue/return, late fees calculation  
- **Movie Ticket Booking (Single Theatre)**  
  - Book seats, cancel, check availability  
  - Show concurrency-safe seat booking logic  

---

### **4. Social / Interaction Systems**
Mini versions of real apps.

- **Chat Room**  
  - Multiple users join, send messages, leave  
  - Observer or Mediator pattern demo  
- **News Feed System (Lite)**  
  - Post messages, follow/unfollow users, fetch latest posts  
- **Online Polling System**  
  - Create polls, vote, show results  

---

### **5. Finance / Transactions**
Great for OOP + small algorithms.

- **Splitwise (Simplified)**  
  - Add expenses, split equally/unequally, show balances  
- **Stock Portfolio Tracker**  
  - Add buy/sell transactions, calculate profit/loss  
- **Currency Converter** (mock rates)  
  - Show design with strategy for conversion rates

üí° **Tips for choosing in an interview**:
- Pick a **problem where you can implement core features in 60‚Äì80 min** and leave optional ‚Äúgood-to-have‚Äù features if time remains.
- Use **3‚Äì4 core classes**, avoid overengineering unless explicitly asked.
- Use **clean, readable code** with meaningful names ‚Äî interviewers prefer clarity over extreme optimizations.

If you want, I can prepare **full requirement docs** for 4‚Äì5 of these problems in the exact **machine coding round format** like companies use (input/output examples + constraints + extension ideas).  
This will be your **ready-to-use practice kit**.
